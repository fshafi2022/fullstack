<p>Chief Justice IHC Athar Minallah led the proceedings of a petition against the suspension of ARY NEWS transmission on cable. The administration of the news channel and senior lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan also appeared before the court.</p>

<p>A PEMRA official appeared before the court and conveyed that they have not suspended the transmission of the channel and blamed the cable operators for it.</p>

<p>

“Stop playing games with the court. There are 4,000 employees whose basic rights are being violated with the suspension of the channel,” the judge remarked. “If you didn’t close the channel then why you haven’t resumed its transmission?” CJ Athar Minallah asked.</p>
<p>
The PEMRA official conveyed that they have issued show-cause notice to the cable operators. “Are you trying to say that cable operators are running the country,” the CJ IHC remarked and directed the PEMRA official to restore the channel on its previous position in an hour.</p>
<p>
